1. Git Repo Maintainance:
   - push local branch to remote: git push (remote) (branch)
   - track remote branch: git checkout -b (branch) (remote/branch)
   - merge branches: git checkout (mergeto branch); git merge (mergefrom branch)

   - Everytime before you resume coding, please pull the repo first, in case other temmember has modifed the code.
